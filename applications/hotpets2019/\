**Abstract**: In this lightning talk, we discuss the importance of bridging the
gap between research on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) for P2P networks
and the current decentralized web industry. In addition, we discuss how to 
design and implement practical software that can be used by system engineers to 
enhance privacy of current P2P systems, while focusing on current open
challenges in production systems such as IPFS and Dat.

# The talk

While the traction of large scale decentralized networks such as IPFS [@ipfs] and Dat
[@dat] has recently increased, the research and application of Privacy Enhancing
Technologies (PETs) for P2P networks has not 

As P2P networks and decentralized systems (re)gain popularity among researchers
and industry alike, it is important to design and implement
decentralized systems that not only preserve users’ privacy but also deliver
on scalability, performance and usability. Failing to deliver on those
properties will render decentralized systems unusable and unattractive for
mass adoption or as a viable alternative to centralized systems.
