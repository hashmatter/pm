				abstract="This paper presents compact message formats for onion routing
								circuit construction using the Sphinx methodology developed for
								mixes. We significantly compress the circuit construction
								messages for three onion routing protocols that have emerged as
								enhancements to the Tor anonymizing network; namely, Tor with
								predistributed Diffie-Hellman values, pairing-based onion
								routing, and certificateless onion routing. Our new circuit
								constructions are also secure in the universal composability
								framework, a property that was missing from the original
								constructions. Further, we compare the performance of our
								schemes with their older counterparts as well as with each
								other.",
