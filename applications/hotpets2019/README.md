## Applied Privacy Enhancing Technology for P2P Networks with p3lib"

**Abstract**: In this lightning talk, we discuss the importance of bridging the
gap between research on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) for P2P networks
and the current decentralized web industry. In addition, we discuss how to 
design and implement practical software that can be used by system engineers to 
enhance privacy of current P2P systems, while focusing on current open
challenges in production systems such as IPFS and Dat.
