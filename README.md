# hashmatter 

**hashmatter** is a research and development lab focused on improving
distributed and P2P protocols towards better privacy and metadata resistance.


Currently, we're working on [research](https://github.com/gpestana/p2psec), 
[development](https://github.com/hashmatter/p3lib) and 
[community outreach](https://github.com/hashmatter/outreach) projects.

## Roadmap 2019

**Main focus: To enable the privacy preserving and metadata resistant decentralised web**

**WIP** The roadmap for the remaining of 2019 is being defined in issue
[#4](https://github.com/hashmatter/pm/issues/4). Once it is completed, this
document will be updated.

### A. Research 
The high level research goal for 2019 is to understand and communicate about
practical decentralized mechanisms and protocols that can be used to enhance 
privacy of Distributed Hash Tables. 

### B. p3lib development
The high level development goal for 2019 is to develop the first iteration
(v0.1) of the building blocks that enable decentralized application developers to
use with libp2p:
 - onion routing on top of DHTs, including secure path discovery;
 - Octopus DHT lookup protocol;
 - multiple plausible deniability protocols.

### C.  Community outreach
The high level community outreach goal for 2019 consists on clearly documenting
the privacy threats of DHTs - both abstractly and in current implementations -
and reach out to project owners and community at large to discuss and address
those problems.
